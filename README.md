## Package to generate biomass objective function stoichiometric coefficients for genome-scale models from experimental data.

### Significance

Genome-scale metabolic models rely both on a defined media and a precise biomass objective function to generate reliable predictions of flux-states and gene essentiality. Often times the biomass objective function is fetched from another organism, namely E.coli. This package aims to produce an easy way to generate biomass stoichiometric coefficients that reflect experimental reality by incorporating dry weight measurments and relative abundances of macromolecules obtained from multiple OMICs datasets. 

### Example use

A full biomass objective function stoichiometric coefficients determination from experimental data fetched from literature for the *E.coli* model *i*ML1515 is available in the Example folder. The files used are also provided.
