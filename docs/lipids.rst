Lipids
======

Lipids are intricate metabolites to model in GEMs. Identifying all lipid species composing the lipidome of an organism can be a daunting task. Modern lipidomics method have allowed to make this task easier by identifying all lipid present in the cell in a single experiment. BOFdat supports the use of lipidomic to generate BOFsc. The filter function also allows to compare lipidomics to the existing model.
